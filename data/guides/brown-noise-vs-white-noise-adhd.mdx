# Brown Noise vs. White Noise: Which Color Helps ADHD Brains Focus?

Silence can feel deafening to an ADHD brain. The absence of stimulation lets every stray thought, keyboard click, or HVAC hum surge to the front of consciousness. That is why a growing number of neurodivergent adults layer **focus sounds**—especially brown noise—under their work sessions. Instead of fighting sensory input, they sculpt it.

## The Spectrum: Brown vs. White vs. Pink Noise

**White noise** is what most people imagine when they think of "static." It delivers equal power at every frequency, which makes it hissy and bright. White noise excels at **auditory masking**—it hides conversations and traffic—but it can become fatiguing for anyone sensitive to high pitch energy.

**Pink noise** tilts that spectrum by halving the power each time frequency doubles. The result is closer to a steady rainfall: gentler high frequencies and a smoother midrange. Pink noise is the neutral middle ground for folks who want something softer than white noise but still bright enough to cut through office chatter.

**Brown noise** (sometimes called red noise) goes even lower. Power increases as frequency drops, creating a rolling thunder or airplane-cabin vibe. The lack of high-frequency energy makes it feel warm and grounding rather than harsh.

## Why Many ADHD Brains Prefer Brown Noise

Neurologists describe ADHD as a regulation disorder rather than a simple attention problem. The brain is constantly seeking the right level of stimulation. Brown noise supplies:

- **Low-frequency proprioceptive vibes** that mirror the sensation of "deep pressure" tools.
- **Internal monologue masking.** The rumble sits where subvocal speech lives, quieting endless self-talk loops.
- **Predictable, no-lyrics texture.** It keeps the default mode network from spinning up daydreams while still occupying enough bandwidth to mute distractions.

White noise, by comparison, can trigger sensory overwhelm or feel like a fluorescent light buzzing in your ear. Pink noise lands between both camps, but when clients tell us they want to "turn off my brain’s narrator," brown is typically the winner.

## Science Snapshot

- **Brown noise = 1/f² distribution.** Power drops 6 dB per octave, packing energy into bass frequencies.
- **White noise = equal power per Hz.** Great for blocking, less great for comfort.
- **Pink noise = 1/f.** Balanced spectrum that aligns more closely with the way our ears perceive loudness.

Multiple small studies (and a mountain of anecdotal evidence) show that lower-frequency soundscapes boost sustained attention for ADHD adults, especially during tasks requiring repetitive focus like coding, accounting, or writing.

## Wondering If It Is ADHD?

If you are using soundscapes daily just to keep your brain on task, it might be time to check whether ADHD is the underlying driver. The fastest way to get clarity is the **WHO ASRS v1.1 screening**, which we host client-side with no email required, so you can launch the [ASRS v1.1 assessment](/test) between noise experiments and track the difference.

## No Ads, No Algorithm—Just a Focus Tool

You do not need Spotify ads, Wi-Fi, or playlists that randomly jump to heavy metal. We built a **free, offline-capable Focus Noise Player** that includes brown, pink, and white tracks in a single click interface.

## How to Blend Noise Into Your Ritual

1. **Match the task.** Deep writing? Start with brown noise. Need a lighter boost? Switch to pink.
2. **Use good speakers or over-ear headphones.** Delivering low frequencies matters.
3. **Layer with intention.** Pair brown noise with Pomodoro timers or body doubling for a complete sensory strategy.

When silence is louder than your thoughts, sculpting sound is self-care. Experiment with the spectrum, note how your nervous system responds, and keep the color that makes your focus feel effortless.
