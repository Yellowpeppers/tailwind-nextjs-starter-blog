# Minimalist Weekly Planner for Chaotic ADHD Brains

Traditional planners fail neurodivergent minds because they demand rigid schedules, dozens of fields, and constant discipline. What we need is a **one-page dashboard** that mirrors how ADHD brains actually operate: energy flows up and down, friction appears randomly, and dopamine needs to be planned just as intentionally as tasks. This guide gives you a printable + digital-friendly template that keeps the week quiet, visual, and actionable.

If the energy crashes and random friction spikes sound like your week, confirm how much ADHD symptom load you’re managing. A 2-minute ASRS check gives you data before you map the planner, and you can rerun our [free neurodivergent screening](/test) whenever those energy graphs feel unpredictable.

## TL;DR: The One-Page Layout

| Section         | Purpose                                          | When to fill                     | Sensory Cue                          |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Energy Forecast | Color blocks mornings/afternoons by energy level | Sunday night or Monday morning   | Highlighters or 3 marker colors      |
| Quiet Pillars   | Three weekly outcomes with bite-sized steps      | Monday planning + midweek check  | Calm Strips near planner edge        |
| Friction Sweep  | Identify blockers + matching regulation tools    | During daily wrap                | Sticky dots or icons                 |
| Dopamine Menu   | Fast/medium/slow rewards matched to effort       | Before week starts, update daily | Keep rewards card clipped to planner |
| Weekly Retro    | Score focus, noise, mood; capture wins           | Friday shutdown                  | Weighted pen or ONO roller           |

## Section 1: Energy Forecast (5 minutes)

Divide the page into seven columns with two rows each (AM/PM). Shade each block using **Green = Steady**, **Yellow = Uncertain**, **Red = Low**. This is not about predicting exact tasks—it’s about choosing **when** to attempt high-friction work.

- Pull from your [Low-Stim Morning Loop](/blog/low-stim-morning-routine) data: Which mornings felt calm? Which afternoons crashed?
- Mark medication peaks or therapy appointments in the margins so you see natural boosts.
- During the week, jot one-word notes (“migraine,” “library,” “client call”) so future-you can spot patterns.

## Section 2: Quiet Pillars (three objectives)

Pick three outcomes only. For each, write:

1. **Outcome statement** (e.g., “Finish Quiet Classroom visual pack”).
2. **Micro-actions** (2–4 bullets) that can be finished in &lt;25 minutes.
3. **Regulation cue** (movement tool, white noise, or accountability buddy) that you’ll pair with that pillar.

Example:

- Pillar: Quiet Classroom visuals
  - Micro-actions: sketch card layout, photograph sensory corner, draft parent letter.
  - Regulation cue: Quiet Sprint timer + weighted lap pad.

## Section 3: Friction Sweep (daily maintenance)

Every evening, scan the day for friction and log two columns:

| Friction          | Counter-tool                                              |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Zoom drained me” | Plan next day’s first task offline, set 45-min camera cap |
| “Desk got noisy”  | Re-run Quiet Desk Audit line items 3 & 4                  |
| “Skipped meals”   | Add Slow Dopamine reward = lunch outside + ambient video  |

Keep friction entries short—this is a log, not a diary. The goal is to see repeating blocks so you know when to deploy the Quiet Desk, Body Doubling, or Morning routines.

## Section 4: Dopamine Menu (attach to planner)

Split rewards into 3 buckets based on effort/time:

- **Fast (≤5 min):** texture card break, stretching with bone-conduction audio, sending a meme to your accountability buddy.
- **Medium (10–20 min):** iced matcha run, short ambient co-working session, mini tidy of the Quiet Corner.
- **Slow (45+ min):** long walk with podcast, crafting sensory tools, art block with noise-canceling headphones.

Match each micro-action from Quiet Pillars to a reward. Write it directly next to the task so you don’t have to invent dopamine when you are already depleted.

## Section 5: Weekly Retro

Friday (or whenever your week ends), rate three sliders 1–5:

- **Focus:** Did Quiet Sprints + Body Doubling keep you on track?
- **Noise:** Was your desk/house under 45 dB most of the time?
- **Regulation:** Did you use tactile tools/morning routines at least once per day?

Then add two bullet prompts:

- **Win:** Something small you completed (e.g., “kept Quiet Desk tidy 4 days”).
- **Roll-over:** One pillar/micro-action to move to next week.

This ensures the planner closes the loop and doesn’t become a guilt artifact.

| Day | AM Energy | PM Energy | Notes                                 |
| :-- | :-------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------ |
| Mon | Green     | Yellow    | Desk quiet; plan to run Body Doubling |
| Tue | Yellow    | Red       | Appointments + commute noise          |
| Wed | Green     | Green     | Use Quiet Classroom toolkit edits     |
| Thu | Red       | Yellow    | Fatigue, schedule Slow Dopamine       |
| Fri | Green     | Green     | Publish Quiet Desk toolkit            |

Quiet Pillars preview:

- Pillar 1: Quiet Desk CTA assets → actions (design mockup, copy review, upload).
- Pillar 2: Body Doubling article → actions (tool table, CTA config, FAQ).
- Pillar 3: Planner template → actions (layout sketch, Canva export, upload PDF).

## How to Use the Template

1. **Print / duplicate Sunday night.** The template fits on A4/Letter; digital users can import to Notion/GoodNotes.
2. **Place in Anchor Zone.** Put the page on a clipboard or stand near your Quiet Desk so it’s within your visual field but not covering screens.
3. **Review twice daily.** Morning: glance at energy blocks + plan micro-actions. Evening: log friction + check off rewards.
4. **Archive weekly.** Snap a photo or slide into a folder. Every month, review trends to adjust routines.

## Download & Stack

- **Download:** Minimalist Weekly Planner (PDF + Notion duplicate link) via the toolkit CTA below.
- **Stack:** Pair with [Body Doubling at Home](/blog/body-doubling-at-home) for accountability and with [Quiet Classroom](/blog/teacher-quiet-sensory-corners) if you manage students.
- **Iterate:** Each Sunday, adjust energy colors and rewards first—tasks come second.
