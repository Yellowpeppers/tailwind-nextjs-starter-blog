**NeuroHacks Lab exists for one clear purpose:** to make life and work more navigable for neurodivergent minds.

We are a small, interdisciplinary team of researchers, clinicians, and experienced “life-hackers” who live with, study, or closely support **ADHD, autism, and related neurotypes**. We combine scientific rigor with practical experimentation, translating research into tools that actually fit into real, messy lives.

### Our Work Spans Three Core Areas:

1.  **Mapping the Science**
    We systematically review evidence from psychology and neuroscience to understand how attention, motivation, and executive function *really* operate in neurodivergent brains.

2.  **Testing Tools in the Real World**
    We experiment with workflows, apps, physical setups, and micro-habits to measure what **genuinely reduces friction** and shame—and what does not.

3.  **Turning Insight into Usable Systems**
    We distill findings into clear, actionable frameworks and experiments you can adapt to your own context, rather than rigid “one-size-fits-all” advice.

> We reject the framing of neurodivergence as a defect to be fixed. Instead, we start from **strengths**: pattern recognition, creativity, deep focus, and non-linear thinking.

Everything we publish is guided by three principles:
* **Evidence over hype**
* **Compassion over blame**
* **Systems over willpower**

If your brain has never quite matched the standard playbook, you are the person we design for. **NeuroHacks Lab** is here to help you understand how your mind works, reduce unnecessary struggle, and build a life that works *with* your wiring, not against it.
